WHY DOES TIME MOVES SLOWER IN STRONGER GRAVITY

Time moves slower in places where gravity is stronger—a concept called gravitational time dilation. This means that near a massive object like Earth or a black hole, time passes more slowly compared to areas with weaker gravity. For example, clocks in satellites tick slightly faster than those on Earth. Scientists even adjust GPS systems for this effect so your location stays accurate. It’s a real and tested part of Einstein’s theory of relativity
